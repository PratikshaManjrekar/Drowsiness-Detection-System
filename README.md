# Drowsiness-Detection-System

- We have used python with OpenCV, Dlib, Flask.
- This is a rel-time monitoring system that uses face tracking and video processing. 
- Our aim is to provide a Driver Drowsiness Detection System, which will alert not only the driver but also the co-passengers with a loud alarm in the car.
